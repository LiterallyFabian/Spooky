You know why you got this tape. Go to Drayton House at 3 AM this Friday. Don't tell anyone.
There's a machine in this room. You have to fix it.
What machine? It’s so dark, I can't see anything.
Ouch, that’s a wall.
An electrical outlet.
A broken electrical cord. I wonder if it still works?
The door is locked.
Ugh… I’m so sick of that sound.
Never thought I’d miss working.
There is something in the fridge. Put it on the table.
This sounds like a fridge, but it’s locked.
Is this a cake? It smells like chocolate.
There is some kind of mechanism on this table.
I think I activated something.
Of course it’s locked…
Charlie gave me a necklace like this once.
I wish I could still play…

It got very quiet. (whisper)
This piano is locked.

Happy birthday! Or uh, death day, I should say! You’re dead. Um, welcome to the other side, oooh! This is your childhood home, right? . . . I’m taking your silence as a no. This all probably seemed very ominous then, sorry! Just walk through that door over there and we’ll celebrate you properly - someone will get the presents from the hallway and the cake from the kitchen. I hope you didn’t see those on your way in. Again, happy death day!
